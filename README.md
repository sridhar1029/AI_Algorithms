# Artificial Intelligence

## AI_Algorithms Repo

One stop for learning most of the important algorithms 
for building your Artificial Intelligence Application.
This repository contains coded examples of all the 
algorithms that will help you learn not just the theory of 
how the algotithm works but also the implementation of 
it in python programming language.

## What is AI?
Artificial Intelligence is about making systems that 
**ACT RATIONALLY**. We build Agents that perceive the 
environment through sensors and process the information to 
act rationally.

Until the 1970's humans used to try to mimic the human 
brain, but did not turn out to be much successful. The 
lessons learnt from the brain were -
> Memory and Simulation are key to decision making.

## What is an Agent?
An agent is an entity that perceives and acts accordingly. 
A rational agent selects actions that maximize its expected 
utility. Characteristics of the percepts, environment and 
action space dictate techniques for selecting rational actions.

There are a lot of new terms that were introduced in the 
previous definition. I will go through all of them, and as
we go on and start implementing the algorithms, you will
understand these concepts even better.

#### Environment 
Environment is nothing but the world for which the agent was
created. An example for this can be, the game environment. 
Imagine you were building an agent to play the game of pacman. 
The environment includes of everything in the pacman world, 
the dots, walls, ghosts, power-ups and the pacman itself. 

#### Action space
Action space is the possible set of actions the agent can take.
Like in the previous example of pacman, the action space was 
(UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). The agent will be the pacman itself 
and the action space is the possible actions the agent can 
select.

## Conclusion
Hope this gives you a good introduction to the world of AI.
You will get a better idea these concepts as the course progresses.
Hope you have a great time doing this course and I am looking 
forward to see the intelligent application that you build 
learning the basics from this course.
